  - [x] Implement methods for creating, fetching, updating, and deleting orders.
  - [x] Ensure transaction handling for the deletion of orders to also delete related `order_items`
- [x] **Order Items Model**: Develop a model to represent the items within an order. 
  - [x] This model should include attributes such as `order_item_id`, `order_id`, `product_id`, `quantity`, and `price`.
  - [x] Implement methods for fetching and creating order items.
- [x] **API Endpoints**
  - [x] **Product Endpoints**:
    - [x] `GET /products`: Fetch a list of all products.
    - [x] `GET /products/:id`: Fetch details of a specific product by its ID.
    - [x] `POST /products`: Add a new product to the database.
    - [x] `PUT /products/:id`: Update the details of an existing product.
    - [x] `DELETE /products/:id`: Remove a product from the database.
  - [x] **Order Endpoints**:
    - [x] `GET /orders`: Fetch a list of all orders.
    - [x] `GET /orders/:order_id`: Fetch details of a specific order by its ID, including the order items.
    - [x] `POST /orders`: Create a new order with order items.
    - [x] `PUT /orders/:order_id`: Update the details of an existing order (e.g., change status).
    - [x] `DELETE /orders/:order_id`: Remove an order from the database.
- [x] **Frontend Integration**
  - [x] Connect the backend API to the provided frontend interface, ensuring dynamic interaction for product browsing, cart management, and order placement. Adjust the frontend as necessary to work with your API.

#### STRETCH FEATURES

- [x] **Added Endpoints**
  - [x] Create an endpoint for fetching all orders in the database.
  - [x] Create an endpoint for serving an individual order based on its ID.
- [ ] **Filter Orders**
  - [ ] Allow users to use an input to filter orders by the email of the person who placed the order.
- [ ] **Implement Your Own Frontend**
  - [ ] Build your own user interface for browsing products, managing the shopping cart, and placing orders. This will involve integrating the frontend you create with the backend API you developed during the project.

### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes, the labs were very helpful for this unit. Specifically lab 3 for how to set up the database and use prisma was useful for referencing during the project.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time I would update the UI to be more user friendly and change the CSS to make the website more responsive/accessible.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

The project demo was difficult this week since the project was all backend. I need to work on explaining the coding process and how the different technologies interact.

### Shout out

Huge shoutout this week to Andy for helping with this project! Also thank you to all my other peers for helping me including Chris, Karina, and Sam.
